Built-in and Non-Built-in modules\n","\n","**Built-in**\n","\n","Built-in modules come with Python. Python has many built-in modules. The random, turtle, math, etc are all built-in modules. \n","\n","To use built-in modules, we just need to import them directly. \n","\n","\n","**Non-Built-in Modules**\n","\n","These modules don't come with Python, and usually developed by other organization, ie scientist, researcher, universities ...... If we want to use these module, we must do extra installation.  These modules are the one expanding Python's abiliby. To give you some examples: \n","\n","* Tensorflow developed by Google allows people to use Python to code AI application. \n","* Matplotlib allows Python to display data for visualization\n","* Microbit developed Python module so we can control the Microbits using Python code\n","* OpenCV developed by Intel let us use Python to do many cool image and video effect\n","\n","![module_icons](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1H6Fg-GLevQoqhk_B0E2um076QJqeKUdG)\n","\n","The non-built-in modules don't come with Python.

How to use Modules?\n","\n","In order to use module, we must first import them. When Python execute the line of importing module, it finds the module from your hard disk, run all the code of that module, and stores them in memory readily for your program to use. \n","\n","An example you have all encountered so far is the randint. Before you can use the randint(), you must first import it from the random module like this.\n","\n","```python\n","from random import randint\n","```\n","\n","Actually there are two ways to import modules. \n","\n","1. You can import the entire module. Then everything in this module, ie. all functions and constants, can be called by adding the module name with a ```.``` in front of the function, like this: \n","\n","```python\n","import random\n","\n","print(\"random.randint output:\", random.randint(0,100))\n","print(\"random.choice output:\", random.choice(['1','b','12','Ottawa','capital']))\n","```\n","\n","Run these code in the code cell below for multiple time to observe what they do. Pay attention that when I need to use function from the random module, I typed ```random.randint()``` and ```random.choice()```. This because I imported the entire random module by ```import random```"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"enAaR9ySfPYj","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1633115808375,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"Fan Zhang","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gh3w-w3eaGsd3sULHqtfyKczRhQ-1lDCbTO_6xl7c0=s64","userId":"16374273409756772064"}},"outputId":"88e26e37-8a8f-4d82-c158-89927c15ecb4"},"source":["# Exercise: run the above code multile times and observe the outcome.\n"],"execution_count":18,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["random.randint output: 12\n","random.choice output: 1\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"BCw358pCixgB"},"source":["2. The second way you can import is to import specific items from the module, like this:\n","\n","```python\n","from random import randint, choice\n","\n","print(\"random.randint output:\", randint(0,100))\n","```\n","\n","In this case, when I need to use the function, I don't need to type ```random.``` anymore, just type the function name directly. \n","\n","However, only the function imported will be available.

Rename module during import\n","\n","Sometimes the module name is long, or we use it very often in our code, that we don't want to type the full name every time. Imagine if you have to use functons from random module for a 100 times in your code...\n","\n","In this case, we can rename the module during import like this:\n","\n","```python\n","import random as rd\n","print(\"random.choice output:\", rd.choice(['1','b','12','Ottawa','capital']))\n","```\n","\n","Now the full module name ```random``` has been shrinked to just two letter ```rd```.
